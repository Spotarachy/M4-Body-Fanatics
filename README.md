## Authentication

Using '''allauth''' confirmation emails will be sent back and forth between the user and our server system to ensure everything has been passed security, usually '''django.core''' mainframe all emails will be handled in the backend of the console,

This will be done in steps to differentiate our customers between our sellers who will be able to add their own products, & Sign Users that will be able to shop our Products, either by using a username or email address, all this will insuring that email to verify your account is necessary and mandatory.

In this way no user can answer to a site without having first using a real email so they will be asked to verify the email twice to create an account and it will be sent a confirmation email to their account enter their email address to make sure it is a working and functional email address.

As an extra precaution a minimum number of letters is required to create a username no less than five letters in so that the system understands we will give a redirect login URL to get our customers back to the main page of Iam site which will automatically receive the information that is how we plan to authenticate.

### Superusers

* As a superuser you'll be able to edit add or delete items from the store and become a seller of your own products on the body fanatics website this is done with the admin on location of the shop was super users can be registered by our team, they will have full control to edit there products add new items to the shop or change the existing items such as prices, description, images, or update to existing product.


### Side uses

## Database schema

Using the '''django''' we make a front end user base any backend user based to interact with each other to handle the data, while he's sitting would be mostly use by Superusers it is also playing a role for our regular users or shoppers were super users has a fully functioning user admin panel we also won our general users to be able to create read an update their information, 

as a superusers from the front or back in will be able to use a framework called CRUD, that stands for create read update and delete all files will be duplicated from the users front end plate and sent it back into storage in the admin using the '''django''' and '''Reroku''', by using the method of get or post request, we hope to handle all our clients needs to this process.


  ### Functionality

    * Create {An SQL INSERT statement adds one or more records to any single table in a relational database.}
        ** 

    * Read {The SQL SELECT statement returns a result set of records, from one or more table}

    * Update {The SQL SELECT statement returns a result set of records, from one or more table}

    * Delete {In the database structured query language (SQL), the DELETE statement removes one or more records from a table. A subset may be defined for deletion using a condition, otherwise all records are removed.[1] Some database management systems (DBMSs), like MySQL, allow deletion of rows from multiple tables with one DELETE statement (this is sometimes called multi-table DELETE).}

# Deployment

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.
